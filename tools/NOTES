Some random notes on the RTOFS V2 port to hera.

1. There is now ice processing. The ssmi executable has now been ported.

2. Not all products are created because cdo is not available on hera. I believe
that cdo is used to create products for OPC only.

3. The NCODA codes are not part of the repo. The hera-compiled binaries are part
of the repo. The NCODA codes are what is in production as of today (20221115).

4. The bufr_dumplist that was implemented on wcoss for RTOFS is not on hera. I
ported it myself and is in the directory under my name. The runtime module 
loads this module.

5. RTOFS makes heavy use of the WCOSS function CFP (Command File Processor).
which is like mpiserial. It is not on hera but I found a home-built one in
/scratch1/NCEPDEV/mdl/apps/modulefiles. This is probably an older version,
but it seems to work fine. (Addendum - it fails sometimes.. so I have removed
some of the CFP calls and only use it when necessary.)

6. The observational data that resides in the monthly tanks is saved on disk
on WCOSS only. This data is bathy, tesac, xbtctd and subpfl. There is a note 
in the get_dcom_data.sh script that shows how to find and rename the data.

7. The launch script ncoda_rtofs_glo.launch.sh is an old script from WCOSS
that I modified for hera. There is probably some dead code in there and
some macros that are set that are no longer used. But it works.

8. RTOFS creates forcing files from the GDAS surface flux files. During real
time, these surface flux files are hourly. However, they are only archived 
every three hours. So when running retrospectives a couple of things have been
modified (or need to be modified).

# this file now sets the interval to 3 hours (intvl=3)

ush/rtofs_prestaging.sh  

# this file tells the scripts how to create the ice forcing and needs to know
# if the atmospheric forcing is hourly or 3-hourly

parm/rtofs_glo.navy_0.08.anal.ice_in.

# check the settings for these keywords

atm_data_type
sss_data_type
sst_data_type

# if 'cfsr', then the atmospheric forcing is hourly
# if 'nogaps', then the atmospheric forcing is 3-hourly
